## Validator Testing

- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

- JS
    - Functions declared in within loops errors were found on three occasions when passing through the official [JSHint validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
    
    - These errors are due to adding event listeners inside of a function. But as far as I know this is the best way to go about it anyway.


### Bugs

- There are no known bugs.

### Solved Bugs

- Instructions content is to long to show all of it, and overflows from the viewport and doesn't scroll 

## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system.
I used push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages.
- I logged into github
- In the GitHub repository, I went to the Settings tab.
- From there I clicked the Pages section and cliked the source drop down menu called Branch and selected main.
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed 

The live link can be found here - https://robingjonsson.github.io//

To run localy:
