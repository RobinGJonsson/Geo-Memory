## Validator Testing

- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Frobingjonsson.github.io%2FGeo-Memory%2F)

- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Frobingjonsson.github.io%2FGeo-Memory%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

- JS
    - Functions declared in within loops errors were found on three occasions when passing through the official [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/)
    
    - These errors are due to adding event listeners inside of a function. But as far as I know this is the best way to go about it anyway.

### Bugs

    - There are no known bugs.

### Solved Bugs

    - Instructions content is to long to show all of it, and overflows from the viewport and didn't scroll.
    - I had put a min-height on the modal it sits on, so by changing it to just height solved the problem.
